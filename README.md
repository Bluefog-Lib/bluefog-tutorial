# BlueFog Tutorials

Welcome to the [BlueFog](https://github.com/Bluefog-Lib/bluefog) tutorials!

In this repository, we've put together a collection of awesome Jupyter notebooks. These notebooks serve two purposes:

- Help readers understand the basic concepts and theories of the decentralized optimization.
- Help readers understand how to implement decentralized algorithms with the BlueFog library.

## Contents

### 1 [Preliminary](https://github.com/Bluefog-Lib/bluefog-tutorial/tree/master/Section%201)

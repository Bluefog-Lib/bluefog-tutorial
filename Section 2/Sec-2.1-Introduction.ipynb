    "## 2.1 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume there exist $n$ computing agents such as CPU or GPU, and each agent $i$ holds a local variable $x_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$. In distributed computing, one of the most important operation is **all-reduce** that let each agent $i$ achieve the global average of all local variables, i.e., $\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i$. Such all-reduce operation is the step that requires significant communication among agents. It is usually the bottelneck that hinders the scalability of distributed systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many approaches to achieving all-reduce, some well-known methods are parameter-server or ring-allreduce. These approaches require global synchoronization across all agents and hence are regarded as **centralized** methods. They typically suffer from either significant bandwidth cost or high communication latency, see \\[1\\]. This motivates **decentralized** approaches in which the bottelneck of global synchonization can be relieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Average consensus** is the most popular decentralized algorithm to achieve global average. Average consensus is based on partial averaging, in which each agent will compute the average of the nodes in its neighborhood. Repeating a series of such local actions can recover the global average of all the nodes in the network. Partial averaging was inspired by the similar processes in biology, animal behavior, and brain neuron [2, 3, 4]. No node maintains any global information in the entire updating process. The following figure illustrates decentralized communication. \n",

    "Average consensus is the foundation of decentralized optimization that we will discuss in later sections. In this section, we will describe the avearge consensus algorithm, discuss its convergence properties, and show how to implement it over the real distributed CPU clusters with BlueFog. We will also explore how the network topology will affect the convergence rate and communication efficiency of average consensus.\n",

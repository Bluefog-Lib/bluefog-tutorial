    "Average consensus is a decentralized algorithm to let each agent reach the global average of each local variables. Given a network of $n$ computing agents, the combination matrix $W$, and the local variables $x_1^0, \\cdots, x_n^0$ (each variable has dimension $d$), the average consensus algorithm is  \n",

    "Average consensus is a recursive algorithm. Each recursion only incurs neighborhood communication. Each recursion of average consensus is conducted in parallel.

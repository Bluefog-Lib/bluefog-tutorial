    "## 4.1 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The logistic problem discussed in Section 4 is how to tackle two types of bias for a finite sum problem in a decentralized environment using stochastic gradient descent. The finite sum problem is the minimization of an average of functions.\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "    f(x) = \\min_{x} \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{i=1}^{M} f_i(x)\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "In a machine learning setting where there is a set of $M$ data points, we can interpret this problem as minimizing the average of $M$ error functions $f_i$ evaluated at the corresponding $i$th data point. Here we assume each $f_i$ is $L_i$-smooth and $f(x)$ is $\\mu$-strongly convex. The first bias comes from the inaccurate gradient estimation due to the stochatic nature of SGD, which can be resolved with a stochastic variance reduced gradient descent (SVRG). The second type of bias is introduced due to the concensus bias of gradient estimation in a decentralized environment, which can be addressed using exact diffusion.\n",
